# Unit Convertor Application
### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see you here.
This is a Unit converter application which is a pure javascript application.

Let's have a look at our application:

Right now, we have units of length, wherein we can convert length from one unit to another. Let's give it a try.

Suppose we need convert 1 Feet into other units. Huh! a lot of calculations, but don't worry! Our application can do it in less than a second. Isn't it so cool? Of course, it is. ðŸ˜Ž

Now, let us convert 1 Kilometer into other units. These are some of those calculations our math teacher asked us to do. But we coders are pretty smart. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

## Let's create our own ToDo list ✅

1. Now, this is our empty Todo list:

2. Since we are coders, we have a lot of work to complete (obviously not the pending projects😁) and it's quite hectic sometimes. So, let's create our own Todo list and add the tasks we need to perform.

3. First, we need to mention the Title and Description of the task. Then, by clicking on the **Add to list**, our item will be added to the list below. We can create any number of list items (depending upto the number of tasks we have procastinated.😂)

4. Once we are done with any of the task, we can simply click on **Delete** option after that task and it will delete that particular task.

5. Now, suppose we have completed all the items mentioned in our Todo list. Then, we can click on **Clear list** button. When we do so, a pop-up will come up asking - **Do you really want to clear?** Choose **OK** if you want to clear, else click **Cancel**.

6. Finally, we have completed all our task and now our Todo list is empty. So, by the steps mentioned above, anyone can create their own Todo list and can definitely improve their productivity. 😉👍
